## Run [Guard][Guard]

Launch Guard through Bundler with:
{% highlight ruby %}
bundle exec guard
{% endhighlight %}

Guard will look for a `Guardfile` in your current directory. If it does not find one, it will look in your `$HOME` directory for a `.Guardfile`.  

### [Rspec][guard-rspec]
For the [Rspec][guard-rspec] implementation add the following to the Gemfile (inside development group) and run bundler:  

{% highlight ruby %}
group :development do
    gem 'growl',                     
    gem 'guard',                     
    gem 'guard-rspec', require: false
end
{% endhighlight %}

After you bundle with the additions to the Gemfile, enter the folloing command to create a prepopulated Guardfile.  
{% highlight ruby %}
guard init rspec
{% endhighlight %}

### [Minitest][guard-minitest]
For the [Minitest][guard-minitest] implementation add the following to the Gemfile (inside development group) and run bundler:  

{% highlight ruby %}
group :development do
    gem 'growl',                        
    gem 'guard',                        
    gem 'guard-minitest', require: false
end
{% endhighlight %}
After you bundle with the additions to the Gemfile, enter the folloing command to create a prepopulated Guardfile.  

{% highlight ruby %}
guard init minitest
{% endhighlight %}

## Install [Guard][Guard]
The simplest way to install Guard is to use Bundler.  
Add `guard` to a projects Gemfile and run `bundle`.  

Outside of the context of app devopment `gem install guard` works just as well.

#### Avoiding gem dependency problems
Running `bundle binstub guard` will create `bin/guard` in your project, which means running `bin/guard` (tab completion will save you a key stroke or two) will have the exact same result as `bundle exec guard`  

#### Resources
- [Guard Plugins]
- [Command line options]

#### Guard Console
Guard shows a [Pry][pry] console whenever it has nothing to do and comes with some Guard specific Pry commands:

- â†©, a, all: Run all plugins.
- h, help: Show help for all interactor commands.
- c, change: Trigger a file change.
- n, notification: Toggles the notifications.
- p, pause: Toggles the file listener.
- r, reload: Reload all plugins.
- o, scope: Scope Guard actions to plugins or groups.
- s, show: Show all Guard plugins.
- e, exit: Stop all plugins and quit Guard

## Install [Growl][Growl]
The [growl][growl_gem] gem is compatible with all versions of [Growl][Growl] and uses a command line tool [growlnotify][Growl] that must be separately downloaded and installed. The version of the command line tool must match your Growl version. The `growl` gem does **not** support multiple notification channels.

You have to download the installer for growlnotify from the [Growl download section][Growl].

To use growl you have to add it to your Gemfile and run bundler:

{% highlight css %}
group :development do
  gem 'growl'
end
{% endhighlight %}
