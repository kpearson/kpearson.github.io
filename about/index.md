__Trial and Error__ is a collection of code and patterns that have worked for me in the past. I create these posts and tutorials as a way to share my path with others as well as to find my own way back. The part of each day I look forward to the most is the part where I get to learn something new.  


I am a __Ruby and Javascript dev__ in Los Angeles California. For the past couple of years I have been a volunteer coach at the annual [Rails Girls Los Angeles] event. I co-organize a [Meetup] in downtown LA which focuses on pair programming. It's open to all levels of experience, and is language agnostic.
